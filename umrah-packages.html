    <h2>Significance of Umrah for the Muslims</h2>

    <p>
      Muslims can perform Umrah any time of the year, excluding the Hajj days.
      It is done to purify their souls and ask forgiveness for the sins that
      they have committed in the past. There is no obligation to Umrah; it can
      be performed multiple times in a lifetime. True believer sets on a
      pilgrimage away from their house and spends their wealth in Allah's way to
      please them. This is one of the reasons why this religious activity is
      seen as a way of eradicating poverty and life burdens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Umrah is seeking blessings from the Almighty and refreshing the faith.
      Hundreds and thousands of Muslims worldwide visit the holy sites in Saudi
      Arabia to pay their respects and perform religious acts. In addition, it
      is also the most soul-lifting Sunnah with great rewards and benefits.
      Besides bringing spiritual purity, Umrah is the source of peace and
      contentment for all Muslims.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our beloved Prophet (PBUH) said that Muslims must alternate between Hajj
      and Umrah as it is responsible for eradicating their sins and poverty.
      Moreover, the person gets purified of sins and poverty like the blacksmith
      bellow eliminates all the impurities from valuable metals like silver,
      iron, and gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, its reward is equal to one of the noblest acts in Islam, which is
      Jihad. Performing Umrah with a pious intention guarantees an entrance into
      Jannah. So, Umrah is of great significance and value for Muslims, and
      devotion is visible among the believers. If you want to go to Umrah from
      the UK, look no further than Hajj Umrah Hub to make it happen for you.

    <p>

      Kaaba is also located in this spiritual city. Madinah is where the Prophet
      (PBUH) spent a good amount of time in his life and is also his burial

      worldwide turn towards Kaaba Makkah five times daily to offer obligatory
      prayers. Being a special place in the Islamic world, over one billion
      Muslims from all races, ethnicities, and cultures visit Saudi Arabia at
      some point in their lives. Umrah is always open, and people come for as
      little as one day to as long as a month.

      month of fasting? Muslims understand the significance of this holy month

    <h3>
      Is it possible to visit other places in Saudi Arabia with Umrah Package?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Since our Umrah Packages have an Umrah visa and not a visit visa, you can
      only visit the following three cities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Makkah</li>
      <li>Madina</li>
      <li>Jeddah</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Are there any age restrictions for your Umrah Packages?</h3>

    <p>
      At Hajj Umrah Hub, we offer Umrah Packages suitable for all ages. However,
      if you are under the age of 18 and want to perform Umrah, you must have a
      parent or a legal guardian with you.
    </p>

    <h3>How much luggage is allowed on flights for Umrah?</h3>

    <p>
      It's important to know that the rules can differ depending on which
      airline you choose and your ticket type. But most airlines usually let you
      bring one big suitcase that weighs up to 23 kg and a smaller bag that you
      can carry with you that weighs up to 7 kg.
    </p>

    <h3>Is it mandatory to have a Mahram for women to perform Umrah?</h3>

    <p>
      Although women are encouraged to go on Umrah with a Mahram, it's not
      required. In the past, Saudi Arabia had a rule that women couldn't go on
      the pilgrimage alone. They had to go with a Mahram.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, now those restrictions have been relaxed. If a woman cannot find
      a Mahram to accompany her on the journey, she can join a group of other
      women and travel with a female tour guide.
    </p>

    <h3>How much time do I need to perform Umrah?</h3>

    <p>
      You can perform Umrah in just a few hours if you are a healthy individual,
      the weather is good, and the crowds are smaller. On average, you can
      perform Umrah in just 4-6 hours. However, after performing the rituals,
      Muslims visit Madina two perform nafl prayers.
    </p>

      take anywhere between 7 to 14 days.
    </p>

    <h3>Do I need to be physically fit to perform Umrah?</h3>

    <p>

      fitness levels. We also recommend wearing comfortable shoes and taking
      frequent breaks to rest during the various rituals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, we also attend to the needs of disabled people. For further
      information regarding that, you can contact our customer support team.
